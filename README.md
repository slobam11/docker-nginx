# My First NGINX Docker Website

This is my first custom web page running inside a Docker container using NGINX.

## ðŸš€ About This Project

I built this project completely on my own â€” without any formal courses, tutorials, or external help. Just me, curiosity, and a bit of AI assistance when needed.

The goal was simple: to understand how Docker works, how NGINX serves static files, and how to connect all the dots by actually building something functional.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to create and structure a simple HTML page.
- How NGINX works as a web server to serve static content.
- How to run and manage Docker containers.
- How to map ports between my machine and a Docker container.
- How to create and track changes in a Git repository.

Most importantly, I now **understand the core concepts**, not just how to follow instructions.

Run the container:

docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html nginx


Open your browser and visit:

I didnâ€™t follow any YouTube videos, paid courses, or step-by-step tutorials. I simply explored, tested, broke things, and fixed them â€” with occasional help from AI when I got stuck.

This is just the beginning. More projects coming soon.
